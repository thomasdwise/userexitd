			version 0.5

OVERVIEW

The Userexitd software is a configurable handler for Tivoli Storage 
Manager events. It allows administrator to filter events using regular
expressions and run various actions for TSM events: send mail and SNMP
traps, write messages into syslog, run various scripts and programs.

This software consists of two parts: a simple shared library (userexit.so), 
which is dynamically linked to the TSM Server as a user exit and communicates 
using a socket with the userexitd daemon, running as a separate service.
Userexitd does event filtering using rules and runs actions. The daemon is 
configured via it's configuration file (XML syntax)
